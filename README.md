# Feature voting
SaaS to vote on what features should be implemented for a given product.  
Mainly used internally right now.  


## Run
- Run the app using `npm run serve`
- Instead of using a command directly to ensure that the elm-live command works on all platforms
    - https://gitmemory.com/issue/wking-io/elm-live/206/580930422
    - Command to run it directly in powershell
        ```powershell
        elm-live .\src\Main.elm "--" --output=elm.js
        ```
